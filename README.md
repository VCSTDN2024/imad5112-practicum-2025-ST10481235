 ## 6. Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

**Challenge 1**: How to perfect calculating average.
**Solution**: Assistance from the module manual.

**Challenge 2**: My application was having a problem running and did not want to run.
**Solution**: Ended up finding errors and fixing them quickly to run the app

From these challenges, i fully learnt how to properly run my app and how to comfortably calculate average.

## 7. Future enhancements
Even though the current app provides the user with the key goal, there are many features that could be added to improve the application for the future.

**Feature 1:** Users my create playlists to their own music choices
**Feature 2:** Allows users to comfortably give their feedback on a specific song
**Feature 3:** Allowing users to be able to use dark mode to save batter usage.

These would improve the level of usability for the application in the future.
